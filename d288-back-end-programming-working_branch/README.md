This is my final project submission for WGU d288-Back end Programming.

The task was to develop a springboot backend to support an existing Angular front end and reference a PostgreSQL database.

The project is based on a vacation booking service.  Users can create a profile and then purchase vacation packages including various excusions.  The application
then generates a random confirmation number and stores the purchase to PostGre.
